Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

none, but 10 and 100 had same amount

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

I think 100,000 simulations in 0m0.660s is just great, it doesn't even take 1 full second
