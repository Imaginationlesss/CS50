sort1 uses: Bubble sort algorithm

How do you know?: Even tho in test 2 it showed the highest time needed to sort the 10,000 randomized numbers is came first is first test where we "get lucky" and numbers were already sorted,
                  plus in test three where I tested reversed numbers

sort2 uses: Merge sort algorithm

How do you know?: It showed the lowest real time used to sort the list of randomized numbers of 10,000 which merge algorithm is really known for, which we also saw in the video time lapse the end
                  of the lecture.
