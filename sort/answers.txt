sort1 uses: Bubble sort algorithm

How do you know?: Even tho in test 2 it showed the highest time needed to sort the 10,000 randomized numbers it came first in the first test where we "get lucky" and numbers were already sorted,
                  plus in test 3 where I tested reversed numbers it needed the highest amount of time and as we already know bubble sort pushes the highest number to the end so it makes sense
                  it needed the most time to push all the biggest number all the way throughout the sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort algorithm

How do you know?: It showed the lowest real time used to sort the list of randomized numbers of 10,000 as well as sorting 50,000 reversed numbers, which merge algorithm is really known for, which
                  we also saw in the video time lapse the end of the lecture.

sort3 uses: Linear sort

How do you know?: First of all it took the highest amount of time to sort already sorted numbers of 5,000 which is the smallest and simplest test we could test algorithms, second i just figured out
                  what the other two sorts were so i was left with the linear.
                  But if we are gonna use our knowledge of the algorithms we can see that it took second place twice which might get us thinking that maybe it's a bubble sort but as already mentioned
                  test 3 just made things really clear when it showed that sort1 took almost 5 seconds to reverse all the numbers when sort 3 just took half of that time 


test 1: s1 s5k = 0.018s rt
        s2 s5k= 0.036s rt
        s3 s5k = 0.063s rt

test 2: s1 ra10k = 0.184s rt
        s2 ra10k = 0.073s rt
        s3 ra10k = 0.122s rt

test 3: s1 re50k = 4.747s rt
        s2 re50k = 0.364s rt
        s3 re50k = 2.487s rt
