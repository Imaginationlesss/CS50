Question 1:
As this list of songs avg.energy = 0.65906, avg.valence = 0.484443 and avg.danceability = 0.71646 this person more likely likes to dance and listens to more energetic music but because valence is below 0.5
most probably likes slow as well as sad/depressed/angry music, and I'm not quite sure how to use this info to choose colours but they have decent aura with all types of music active energetic as well as sad which than averages like stats provided.

Question 2:
Well because i have no idea which colour represents exactly what so I just assumed, but to be real this mood and aura thing doesn't really define humans, it's just something that's fun/interesting but not factual, everyone sees colours differently so whatever it is
it's good and it works and it's enough, if it makes anyone happy or feeling better abouit themselves.
