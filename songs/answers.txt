As this list of songs avg.energy = 0.65906, avg.valence = 0.484443 and avg.danceability = 0.71646 this person more likely likes to dance and listens to more energetic music but because valence is below 0.5
most probably likes slow as well as sad/depressed/angry music, and I'm not quite sure how to use this info to choose colours
